### Github Resume
During this weeks we have been learning about code lines and commands, most especifically, about git commands.
Here I am going to put some of the most important commands that we use and their uses.

* Define author name
```bash
git config user.name <name>
```
* Start a new repository
``` bash
git init
```
* Copy a repository into your local files
```bash
git clone <link of the repository>
```
* Add a new file
```bash
git add <file>
```
* Create a commit
```bash
git commit -m "first commit"
```
* Show the status of the files
