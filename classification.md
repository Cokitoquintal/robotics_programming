* **Silver - Exam Style Questions TOTAL 6 marks**

 1.  *Explain why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages, would normally use a high-level language when writing programs? (4 Marks)*

`` High-level languages have lots of advantages, are easier to interpret because these use words and interactions from the real word, being more comfortable for the developer, also, these have selection and iteration constructions, and Boolean operators that permit complex statements. In general, high-level languages are the most popular and most used, it is more understandable, and the processes are even faster. ``

2.  *What is machine code? (1 Mark)*

`` It is the result of a program that has been translated by a compiler, interpreter or assembler to binary, being a sequence of computer instructions in binary code, these instructions could be in 32 bits form or 64 bits form. Although, the code is different in every computer and it depends on the processor architecture. ``

3.  *Give an example of a high-level language? (1 Mark)*

`` Java is a high-level language to programming. It can be used to write code using English-based commands and is very easy to understand by us. After write the instructions in java, a translator has to be used to have a code that could be executable in computers. ``

* **Gold - Answer the following questions: TOTAL 12 marks**

1.  *Describe three differences between low-level language and high-level languages? (6 Marks)*

* High-Level languages are easier to understand because are written in human language, and Low-Level languages are written in binary code or assembly languages, those are not simple as H-L and only high skill programmers can easily use them.

* High-Level languages use English language and words that are used in daily life, meanwhile, Low-Level languages have two classifications, machine code that uses binary code; and assembly language, that uses mnemonics (text abbreviations) and numbers.

* High-level languages are not directly understandable for computers, these must be traduced to machine code in binary code, so can be executable.

2.  *What does a translator do? (2 Marks)*

`` It takes H-L languages and make it understandable for the computer systems. Those translators can be compilers, assemblers, or interpreters. ``

3.  *Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code? (4 Marks)*

* Interpreters: after finishing the program, it is immediately translated in machine code, and execute it. Then, the program will run but it has to be translated each time by the interpreter, being slower, this time depends on the complexity of the program. However, it shows any error, so it easier to fix.

* Compilers: it takes all the source code and converts it at the same time, to create the compiled code (machine code). After the creation of a program, the whole program must be compiled, but before this, small parts are compiled to test. When compile is finished, it runs a list of errors that must be fixed before running the program. To finish, these compiled programs a are faster to run, also, the source code cannot be copied or even be seen.

* **Platinum - Exam questions TOTAL 10 marks**

1.  *What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler? (4 Marks)*

`` Both have advantages between them, when a program is compiled, all the source code is taken and traduced, it creates a new file separated from the original, but this process takes a while. Interpreters are different, because nondifferent file is created, and the code is immediately executed.  
However, interpreters traduce every time the program, taking time, but it shows any error, so it is easy to identify and fix, in contrast, compilers takes much time compiling, but it has to be done just 1 time, and are faster to run, but it shows a list of errors after the compilation, so identifying errors could be harder. ``

2.  *What is assembly language? (2 Marks)*

``` It is a type of Low-level language, friendlier with humans, because it uses mnemonics, that are abbreviations of commands such as LD for LOAD, STO for STORE, and ADD. Although, it still needs to be translated into machine code. These instructions are specifically for the hardware in wich is being programmed. ```

3.  *A developer is writing a program.*

a) The program is written in a high-level language and it is then translated into machine code. Describe two differences between high-level language and machine code? (2 Marks)

* The developer wrote the instructions of his code in English language, using commands, numbers, and the alphabet, but the result is in binary code, being 0’s and 1’s.

* The code is understandable to other developers, in fact, is easy to interpret. Although, the translated code is unique for the system in which the code was translated, so other systems cannot execute it.

b) One type of translator is an interpreter.

i) Describe how an interpreter translates high-level language programs into machine code? (1 Mark)

* The interpreter translates one line of the source code at time, and run it, this process is repeated each time that the program wants to be executed, and it is relatively slow, but it does not need to be compiled.

ii) State the name of a different type of translator that can be used to translate high-level code into machine code? (1 Mark)

* Assembler: This translates assembly language into machine code, being a compiler but can also be used as an interpreter. Every instruction is translated into a single machine code instruction.
